 Homework 4 - Heroes of Pymoli (Pandas)

	This Homework assignment was very frustrating. I am really struggling with pandas.
	I found that even after spending hours looking through past activities, reviewing zoom videos of class sessions, and practicing google-fu
	I couldn't really make progress on certain aspects of the assignment.
	On top of all that I still don't really know how to make a good "detailed" readme.
	What does a good readme look like when it's just for a homework assignment?
	
	What follows is a list of the sections of the homework assignment:

		Player Count: Finished
		Purchasing Analysis(Total): Finished
		Gender Demographics: Finished
		Purchasing Analysis (Gender): Finished
		Age Demographics: Finished (formatting problems)
		Purchasing Analysis(Age): Unfinished
		Top Spenders: Unfinished
		Most Popular Items: Unfinished
		Most Profitable Items: Unfinished
